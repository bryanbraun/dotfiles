# Bryan's Dotfiles

Improves vim and git. Also adds some nice terminal colors.

## Branches

* `master`: Includes bash customizations using [Barry Clark's bashstrap](https://github.com/barryclark/bashstrap), which is a pretty cool project.
* `zsh`: A 2nd iteration using [Robby Russell's oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and a few plugins. It also includes a symlink install script for [easy dotfiles managment](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/).
