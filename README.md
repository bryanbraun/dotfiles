# Bryan's Dotfiles

They are currently pretty lean. Much of my terminal customization basically just uses [Barry Clark's bashstrap](https://github.com/barryclark/bashstrap), which is a pretty cool project.

Also, remember to include [Mathias Bynens' OSX defaults](https://mths.be/osx).

I'd love to hear suggestions if you have them.
